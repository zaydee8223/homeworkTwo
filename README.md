## Weather Forecast API

Web4 Link: 

This week, our assignment was to provide weather data for specified cities or zip codes. The app retrieves data from the Weather API and displays current weather conditions and a 7-day forecast with additional details for each day. 
The main goals of this assignment were: 
- Understand how to retrieve and display data on a site
- Create an application that will get a JSON file and retrieve the needed data
- Create input boxes to get a city or zip code
- Have a fully styled app, making it look like a weather app
- Have a login and signup button
- Allow a user to see a set number of days in a forecast
- Incorporate over 80% of the information in the API JSON object

Features:
- City/Zip Code Input
- Current Weather Display
- 7-Day Forecast
- More Info Button

To utilize the app, enter a city name, state, or zipcode in the input field. Click the "Get Weather" button, and retrieve weather data. Review the current weather and the 7-day forecast!
